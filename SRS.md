#### Decision Table Logic:

1. **User needs to register:**
   - If the user is not registered, has no pre-existing ID, signup is not complete, and login is not successful, the outcome is that the user needs to register.

2. **User logs out without viewing portfolio or searching stocks:**
   - If the user is not registered, login is successful, and the user logs out without viewing the portfolio or searching stocks, the outcome is that the user logs out without engaging in portfolio or stock activities.

3. **User logs out after viewing portfolio:**
   - If the user is not registered, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, and then logs out, the outcome is that the user logs out after viewing the portfolio.

4. **User buys/sells stocks:**
   - If the user is not registered, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, searches stocks, payment is successful, and either buys or sells stocks, the outcome is that the user engages in buying/selling stocks.

5. **User logs out after viewing stocks but without buying/selling:**
   - If the user is not registered, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, searches stocks, payment is successful, and then logs out without buying/selling, the outcome is that the user logs out after viewing stocks but without engaging in buying/selling.

6. **User logs out without viewing portfolio or searching stocks (Registered):**
   - If the user is registered, has a pre-existing ID, signup is not applicable, login is successful, but the user logs out without viewing the portfolio or searching stocks, the outcome is that the user logs out without engaging in portfolio or stock activities.

7. **User logs out after viewing portfolio (Registered):**
   - If the user is registered, has a pre-existing ID, signup is not applicable, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, and then logs out, the outcome is that the user logs out after viewing the portfolio.

8. **User buys/sells stocks (Registered):**
   - If the user is registered, has a pre-existing ID, signup is not applicable, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, searches stocks, payment is successful, and either buys or sells stocks, the outcome is that the user engages in buying/selling stocks.

9. **User logs out after viewing stocks but without buying/selling (Registered):**
   - If the user is registered, has a pre-existing ID, signup is not applicable, login is successful, the user views the portfolio, searches stocks, payment is successful, and then logs out without buying/selling, the outcome is that the user logs out after viewing stocks but without engaging in buying/selling.

10. **Invalid Username/Password:**
    - If the user is registered, has no pre-existing ID, signup is not applicable, login is not successful, and the outcome is an invalid username/password.
